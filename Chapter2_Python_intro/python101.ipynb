      "[Python](http://www.python.org/) is a high level programming language that is freely available, relatively easy to learn and portable across different computing systems. In Python, you can rapidly develop solutions for the sorts of problems you might need to solve in your MSc courses and in the world beyond. Code written in Python is also easy to maintain, is (or should be) self-documented, and can easily be linked to code written in other languages.\n",

      "\n",
      "- it is automatically compiled and executed \n",
      "- code is portable provided you have the appropriate Python modules. \n",
      "- for compute intensive tasks, you can easily make calls to methods written in (faster) lower-level languages such as C or FORTRAN \n",
      "- there is an active user and development community, which means that new capabilities appear over time and there are many existing extensions and enhancements easily available to you.\n",
