    "UNIX is a multi-user operating system: that is, a suite of programs which run on a computer and allows interface to the hardware and software available. It allows many users to share a powerful machine and all the available resources, each user running their own processes simultaneously. This true multi-tasking aspect of UNIX allows a far greater flexibility than is possible with other operating systems, even more recent multi-tasking versions of popular PC operating systems (note that the linux is simply a ‘flavour’ of UNIX & that the Mac operating system OS-X has a good deal of UNIX system within it). The advantages of a truly flexible multi-tasking operating system has been demonstrated with the popularity of UNIX in the scientific, engineering and financial communities, along with the rise of Linux and OS-X.\n",

    "X11 is the windowing system that you will generally use to interface with the operating system. A key aspect of this has always been the idea of remote graphical user interfaces via X11, which allows a user to run and visualise processes on different Unix machines. You are not limited to accessing the computer you are sat in front of, but can easily make wider use of local or external resources. You will find this useful as you can log on to the UCL Geography Unix computers from outside UCL (from pretty well any other operating system) and (with appropriate X11 software such as cygwin or exceed, if you are working from a Windows computer, or directly from any Unix/linux computer os OS-X machine) run windowing sessions the same as if you were physically at the UCL computer (given sufficient bandwidth)."

    "Workstations that run UNIX are not like the way most people use PCs running Windows... At any time of the day or night a UNIX machine is running literally hundreds of processes simultaneously: Some are long-term user processes (such as research experiments) placed at low priority to avoid affecting other users, which may run for weeks, but most are concerned with the second by second activities of maintaining the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Physically, the network consists of 'wires' (ethernet cables, phone lines, fibre-optic cables etc.) or wireless connections (locally and externally) running between computers both at local and remote sites. At the local level (within a University Dept. for example) the wires literally connect every machine to every other, either in a loop, or in a star-like arrangement with machines linked around central communications hubs. Such arrangements of connections, machines and attached peripheral devices is known as a Local Area Network or LAN. Larger arrangements of connections, for instance between departments in a university rather than individual computers, are known as Wide Area Networks or WANs.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is through this ability to transparently network computers together that UNIX really gains its power. Very often the data a user processes on one computer is actually stored on another (a paradigm that has (indirectly) led to the development of the Internet and World Wide Web). Similarly it is commonplace to process data on one machine whilst physically sitting in quite a different location (even on a different continent!). The limiting idea of the machine that you are sitting in front of being the machine you are using for processing (as in the PC-based computing environment) is very much obsolete in the case of UNIX computing. Using the network, it is also possible to break large processes into a number of smaller jobs and distribute them across multiple machines simultaneously, thereby reducing execution times dramatically. In a properly set-up UNIX LAN network, the storage of a users data on a remote machine, or their working on a remote machine should be a relatively transparent operation. Such concepts of networking are not confined to UNIX machines, although UNIX (in all its varieties) is far and away the most common from of operating system used for wide area networking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because a UNIX machine never stops processing, the are **never switched off** by anyone other than the system manager or a relevant member of staff. Simply switching off as you might with a PC can cause irreparable damage to a UNIX machine and/or the data stored on it - remember, your data/project could be on the disk you just killed, so don’t do it! If you think that there is something wrong with a machine, do not attempt to fix it yourself: call or email the system manager or ask a knowledgeable person for advice. Under no circumstances should you attempt to reboot a workstation yourself, as unless shut down properly damage to data, both yours and that of others is likely to result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many workstations you will come across have a simple power-saving device: the screen turns itself off if the keyboard hasn’t been used for a few minutes. To turn the screen back on, simply press a key on the keyboard such as shift, ctrl or the space bar. Often the monitor will have been turned off by the last user to save power (and to stop the lab heating up!) - in most cases, the monitors have a switch or button located on the lower right front of the monitor. If the monitor is on, a small green LED will light up. This is the only switch you should ever touch on the workstations. If it’s not on the front of the monitor, please leave it alone."

If you leave yourself logged on then other people may come along and use your account, access your email etc. Whilst in a University environment this is not necessarily a problem - the next user will probably come along and log you out so that they can log on themselves it is important to log out so that other people don’t waste time wondering whether you have finished, or have just popped out for a few minutes. Don’t lock your workstation - this is anti-social behaviour as it prevents anyone else using it, and if we see it we’ll log you out anyway, and probably take all your pocket money away. If you leave for more than a few minutes, log yourself out. One of the advantages of a UNIX system is that you can leave a job running in the ‘background’ (don’t worry, we’ll get to that later) which means it’ll keep running for as long as you want even after you log out."

    "All information in UNIX, whether it is a program, data or text, is stored in files. These files are maintained by the operating system on hard disks (usually), and read into the computer’s memory when required. Files may be grouped together in directories (equivalent to folders), and these directories may themselves contain other directories and/or files. In fact, directories are really a special kind of file, but the user perceives the whole structure as forming a hierarchy of files and directories. This hierarchy is known as the filesystem. When UNIX computers are networked, the filesystem is not contained within one single machine, but spans the entire network. Each file and directory within the network filesystem is addressable via its own unique name - its filename, or directory name, and to the user the fact that the filesystem straddles multiple machines and hard disks goes largely unnoticed.\n",

    "*    second, if you think about what you want to achieve with the command, (change directory to somewhere) it should be quite apparent that apart from the command, you also need to give the shell an indication of where you want to go (`/` here) so you (normally) will have to type cd somewhere where somewhere is where you want to go. When you are first using these commands, pausing and thinking about what you want to achive is particularly important. Later, it will generally become second nature (as when you learn any new language).\n",

You can purchase that software, or at no cost, use a WTS session (see above) to start up [exceed](http://faq.rutgers.edu/?q=node/836) and then use e.g. `putty` (or tools in exceed) with `X11` forwarding. \n",

This might seem a little ‘roundabout’, but you will soon get used to it and it is like this for good security reasons.\n",

    "\n",
    "Finally, if what you want to do with `ssh` is not to run an interactive session, but to run a process on the remote machine (e.g. for some parallel processing), then you would normally use `ssh -f` for this, with the option `-X` (or `-Y` for OS X) if the processing requires `X11`. A simple example would be, get a listing of your home directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "```home% ssh -f ucfaabc@shankly.geog.ucl.ac.uk \"ls -l /home/plewis\"```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will execute the sequence of commands in quotes on the remote machine, then, when completed, terminate the session (that is what the `-f` flag does). If you want to ssh from that machine onto another (to run a process) that is a little more involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to do this would be e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "```home% ssh -f shankly.geog.ucl.ac.uk 'ssh -f berlin.geog.ucl.ac.uk \"uname -a;pwd; cd /home/plewis ; ls -l\"'```\n",
    "\n",
    "which will `ssh` onto `shankly.geog.ucl.ac.uk` and from there run an `ssh` process onto `berlin` and then run the requested sequence of commands. Note that in this case you will have needed to previously ssh'd from `shankly` to `berlin` to have responded to the authentification request. This is a littler convoluted, especially the use of quotes here but is it feasible and sometimes useful to do this. You are much more likely to make use of this sort of command directly from within the UCL Geography system, in which case you do not need multiple levels of `ssh` calls to get through the firewall."
