    "Jupyter notebooks are accessed through the browser, and it is possible to run the jupyter notebook on the computers in the UCL Geography lab, but still access the browser remotely (either from a laptop while on UCL, or from anywhere else).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also possible to access the UNIX shell remotely, and doing this is a requirement for accessing the Jupyter notebooks remotely. Let's first look at accessing the UNIX shell remotely first.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Remote access to your UCL shell\n",
    "\n",
    "The UNIX lab computers can be accessed using the `ssh` command. This command is encrypted and allows one to connect to a remote computer through the Internet. On **Linux** and **MacOSX**, `ssh` is installed by default. On **Windows**, it has to be installed. A good option for this is [MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/), although there is also [Kitty](http://www.9bis.net/kitty/) if you like more bare-bones systems (and a less restrictive license).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will assume that you want to access your home directory. You can do this by \"ssh-ing\" to one of the bastion computers that are open to the outside internet:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `arch.geog.ucl.ac.uk`\n",
    "* `round.geog.ucl.ac.uk`\n",
    "* `square.geog.ucl.ac.uk`\n",
    "* `triangle.geog.ucl.ac.uk`\n",
    "\n",
    "In Linux or MacOSX, you can simply do this using the command\n",
    "\n",
    "    ssh -YXC username@triangle.geog.ucl.ac.uk\n",
    "    \n",
    "where `username` needs to be substituted by your Geography Linux username. The system will prompt you for a password (note that if you start typing, it will not print anything back, this is normal), and as finish typing the password and pressing \"Return\", you'll be logged into your home space. \n",
    "\n",
    "This isn't very exciting: the bastion computers have little software installed, and they're a *gateway* to the other computers in the lab. However, they work fine for transferring files to and from your own computer and Geography's Linux system.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accessing a lab computer\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've logged into to one of the bastion hosts, you can use `ssh` again to log into a lag machine, e.g. `ankara`:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ssh -YXC username@ankara.geog.ucl.ac.uk\n",
    "\n",
    "This is equivalent as being sitting down in front of the terminal in the lab. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Actually accessing the  Jupyter notebooks remotely\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have access, you can launch the Jupyter notebook\n",
