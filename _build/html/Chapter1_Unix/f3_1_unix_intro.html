<h2>1.2 Unix<a class="headerlink" href="#unix" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This course will be taught mainly under a Unix operating system. The
operating system allows you access to the running of the computer (and
associated devices on the network), and enables you to be able to
control what you want the computer to do.</p>
<p>There is some overhead to learning this (like learning a new language),
but we will introduce you to the basic operations you will need in this
session.</p>
<p>There are many online tutorials on unix. A good place to start backup
material and some more features for the material we will cover today is
<a class="reference external" href="http://software-carpentry.org/v3/shell01.html">software-carpentry.org</a></p>
<p>The interface for these notes is done using something called <em>ipython
notebooks</em>, that we will return more to later.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, this is mainly aimed at running commands in the python
programming language.</p>
<p>In this section of the notes, we will be using <em>unix</em> commands, where we
are working directly with the operating system (rather than in the
python language and environment that is on top of the underlying
system).</p>
<p>One really convenient feature of ipython notebooks is that you, the
student, can simply download then (using the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Download</span> <span class="pre">notebook</span></tt>
button in the corner of the browser display) and then run them on your
local computer. When you have downloaded a notebook, you can use it by
typing:</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">berlin%</span> <span class="pre">ipython</span> <span class="pre">notebook</span></tt></p>
<p>which will open a web browser with an interface tou your notebooks.</p>
<p>You <em>can</em> execute (&#8216;run&#8217;) each block of code by selecting the code block
(click on it) and simply hitting the return key. This conveniently works
with basic unix commands as well as python commands.</p>
<p>As an example of some commands we will use later</p>
<div class="code python highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>cd ~
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>/Users/plewis
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="code python highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">pwd</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="s">u&#39;/Users/plewis&#39;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>These two commands (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cd</span> <span class="pre">~</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pwd</span></tt>) are <em>unix</em> commands (that we
happen to have run here through the ipython interpreter). You can, as we
have suggested, simply download the notebook and hit <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;return&gt;</span></tt> to run
these, but to get used to using the underlying operatoring system, you
will want to open a <em>terminal</em> or <em>shell tool</em> (or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">xterm</span></tt> in some
cases). This is a &#8216;window&#8217; which has a <em>command line prompt</em> at which
you can type and execute unix commands.</p>
<p>It will look something like this:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="" src="Chapter1_Unix/files/images/terminal.png" />
</div>
<p>where, in this case the command line prompt is <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pallas%</span></tt>, where
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pallas</span></tt> happens to be the name of one of the computers we might use.</p>
<p>You type the commands at the prompt, then hit <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;return&gt;</span></tt> (i.e. the
return key) to execute (run) the command.</p>
<p>When you open a new &#8216;terminal&#8217;, you will usually be <em>located</em> in your
<em>home directory</em>. We will discuss this further below.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s check that now, and introduce the command <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pwd</span></tt> (print working
directory) that will print (in the terminal) where we currently are
working.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="" src="Chapter1_Unix/files/images/terminal1.png" />
</div>
<p>So, whilst you <em>can</em> simply hit <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;enter&gt;</span></tt> in the code blocks here, we
will want you to run the unix commands in todays session in a terminal.</p>
<p><strong>Open a terminal now, and run the command ``pwd`` to get used to
this.</strong></p>

<h2>1.3 What is Unix?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-unix" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>UNIX is a multi-user operating system: that is, a suite of programs
which run on a computer and allows interface to the hardware and
software available. It allows many users to share a powerful machine and
all the available resources, each user running their own processes
simultaneously. This true multi-tasking aspect of UNIX allows a far
greater flexibility than is possible with other operating systems, even
more recent multi-tasking versions of popular PC operating systems (note
that the linux is simply a ‘flavour’ of UNIX &amp; that the Mac operating
system OS-X has a good deal of UNIX system within it). The advantages of
a truly flexible multi-tasking operating system has been demonstrated
with the popularity of UNIX in the scientific, engineering and financial
communities, along with the rise of Linux and OS-X.</p>
<p>X11 is the windowing system that you will generally use to interface
with the operating system. A key aspect of this has always been the idea
of remote graphical user interfaces via X11, which allows a user to run
and visualise processes on different Unix machines. You are not limited
to accessing the computer you are sat in front of, but can easily make
wider use of local or external resources. You will find this useful as
you can log on to the UCL Geography Unix computers from outside UCL
(from pretty well any other operating system) and (with appropriate X11
software such as cygwin or exceed, if you are working from a Windows
computer, or directly from any Unix/linux computer os OS-X machine) run
windowing sessions the same as if you were physically at the UCL
computer (given sufficient bandwidth).</p>
<p>Workstations that run UNIX are not like the way most people use PCs
running Windows... At any time of the day or night a UNIX machine is
running literally hundreds of processes simultaneously: Some are
long-term user processes (such as research experiments) placed at low
priority to avoid affecting other users, which may run for weeks, but
most are concerned with the second by second activities of maintaining
the network.</p>
<p>Physically, the network consists of &#8216;wires&#8217; (ethernet cables, phone
lines, fibre-optic cables etc.) or wireless connections (locally and
externally) running between computers both at local and remote sites. At
the local level (within a University Dept. for example) the wires
literally connect every machine to every other, either in a loop, or in
a star-like arrangement with machines linked around central
communications hubs. Such arrangements of connections, machines and
attached peripheral devices is known as a Local Area Network or LAN.
Larger arrangements of connections, for instance between departments in
a university rather than individual computers, are known as Wide Area
Networks or WANs.</p>
<p>It is through this ability to transparently network computers together
that UNIX really gains its power. Very often the data a user processes
on one computer is actually stored on another (a paradigm that has
(indirectly) led to the development of the Internet and World Wide Web).
Similarly it is commonplace to process data on one machine whilst
physically sitting in quite a different location (even on a different
continent!). The limiting idea of the machine that you are sitting in
front of being the machine you are using for processing (as in the
PC-based computing environment) is very much obsolete in the case of
UNIX computing. Using the network, it is also possible to break large
processes into a number of smaller jobs and distribute them across
multiple machines simultaneously, thereby reducing execution times
dramatically. In a properly set-up UNIX LAN network, the storage of a
users data on a remote machine, or their working on a remote machine
should be a relatively transparent operation. Such concepts of
networking are not confined to UNIX machines, although UNIX (in all its
varieties) is far and away the most common from of operating system used
for wide area networking.</p>
<p>Because a UNIX machine never stops processing, the are <strong>never switched
off</strong> by anyone other than the system manager or a relevant member of
staff. Simply switching off as you might with a PC can cause irreparable
damage to a UNIX machine and/or the data stored on it - remember, your
data/project could be on the disk you just killed, so don’t do it! If
you think that there is something wrong with a machine, do not attempt
to fix it yourself: call or email the system manager or ask a
knowledgeable person for advice. Under no circumstances should you
attempt to reboot a workstation yourself, as unless shut down properly
damage to data, both yours and that of others is likely to result.</p>
<p>Many workstations you will come across have a simple power-saving
device: the screen turns itself off if the keyboard hasn’t been used for
a few minutes. To turn the screen back on, simply press a key on the
keyboard such as shift, ctrl or the space bar. Often the monitor will
have been turned off by the last user to save power (and to stop the lab
heating up!) - in most cases, the monitors have a switch or button
located on the lower right front of the monitor. If the monitor is on, a
small green LED will light up. This is the only switch you should ever
touch on the workstations. If it’s not on the front of the monitor,
please leave it alone.</p>
<div class="section" id="passwd">
<h3>passwd<a class="headerlink" href="#passwd" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The UNIX prompt is a sequence of characters that the part of the
operating system (OS) that you interact with, known as the <em>shell</em>,
places at the start of each line when it is expecting you to enter a
command. Often this prompt will be formed by the name of the machine to
which you are logged in, followed by a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">%</span></tt> sign. For instance:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>berlin%</div></blockquote>
<p>which will indicate that you are logged on through a window (which you
might call a terminal or a shell though these are subtly different
things).</p>
<p>The nature of the prompt will vary from system to system, but the
Geography machines have a prompt as above. When you become experienced
you can customise the prompt to your own liking. The cursor (a small
solid rectangle or underscore symbol) placed after the prompt tells you
where your current typing position is (clicking in the window with the
mouse doesn’t mover the cursor - it always remians at the end of the
current line you’re on). The current line with the prompt is therefore
known as the command line. Depending on the particular shell you are
using and the sort of keyboard you have, you may be able to use up and
down arrows to quickly go back through commands that you have typed at
that prompt (in that shell session) (i.e. your history).</p>
<p>The first time you log in, you will be given a default password (this is
the same for all students).</p>
<p>You should make sure that you change your password as soon as possible,
but this needs to be something you will remember (as with all passwords)
and secure enough that it can&#8217;t easily be guessed. You could possibkly
use the same password that you have for your ucl system account (or a
variant of it). UCL will force you to change it every 3-6 months, so
make sure youy also change your password on the system here. If you
forget your password, you will need to see or email the system manager
to get them to reset it (it is encrypted so they can&#8217;t know what it is,
but they can reset it).</p>
<p>To change your password, type <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">passwd</span></tt> at the command prompt and
follow the instructions:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>berlin% passwd</div></blockquote>
<div class="section" id="logging-out">
<h4>1.3.3 Logging out<a class="headerlink" href="#logging-out" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>When you have finished your session at the computer, you must log off.
To achieve this from a remote PC/Mac connection, simply type logout or
exit at the prompt. From within a windowing session at the machine
itself, select the logout option from your root menu (see the section on
the windowing system for more details), and then confirm the logout by
clicking on yes. If you leave yourself logged on then other people may
come along and use your account, access your email etc. Whilst in a
University environment this is not necessarily a problem - the next user
will probably come along and log you out so that they can log on
themselves it is important to log out so that other people don’t waste
time wondering whether you have finished, or have just popped out for a
few minutes. Don’t lock your workstation - this is anti-social behaviour
as it prevents anyone else using it, and if we see it we’ll log you out
anyway, and probably take all your pocket money away. If you leave for
more than a few minutes, log yourself out. One of the advantages of a
UNIX system is that you can leave a job running in the ‘background’
(don’t worry, we’ll get to that later) which means it’ll keep running
for as long as you want even after you log out.</p>

<div class="section" id="the-unix-file-system">
<h2>1.4 The UNIX file system<a class="headerlink" href="#the-unix-file-system" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>All information in UNIX, whether it is a program, data or text, is
stored in files. These files are maintained by the operating system on
hard disks (usually), and read into the computer’s memory when required.
Files may be grouped together in directories (equivalent to folders),
and these directories may themselves contain other directories and/or
files. In fact, directories are really a special kind of file, but the
user perceives the whole structure as forming a hierarchy of files and
directories. This hierarchy is known as the filesystem. When UNIX
computers are networked, the filesystem is not contained within one
single machine, but spans the entire network. Each file and directory
within the network filesystem is addressable via its own unique name -
its filename, or directory name, and to the user the fact that the
filesystem straddles multiple machines and hard disks goes largely
unnoticed.</p>
<p>The filesystem may be visualised as the roots of a tree. At the very top
level of the filesystem on each individual machine resides the root
directory, denoted / (slash).</p>
<p>Beneath this directory lie the other directories containing files and
further directories, including data and references to data stored
elsewhere on the network.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="" src="https://raw.github.com/profLewis/geogg122/master/diagramSystem1.png" />
</div>
<div class="section" id="dotdot">
<h3>dotdot<a class="headerlink" href="#dotdot" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We have already mentioned that every file or directory in the filesystem
is uniquely addressable by its filename or directory name. In fact a
file’s full name is a description of the path from the root of the file
system to the file itself. For instance, the directory <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">plewis</span></tt> under
the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">home</span></tt> directory has the full name:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>/home/plewis</div></blockquote>
<p>Note that as well as being the root of the filesystem, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/</span></tt> is also
used as a directory separator for full filenames and paths (note that is
the opposite of the Windows/DOS directory separator <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">\</span></tt>). Here the
directory <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">plewis</span></tt> is reached by starting at the root of the system,
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/</span></tt>, going into the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">home</span></tt> directory. A directory contained within
another directory is known as a sub-directory of its parent, or
container, directory. The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/home/</span></tt> section of the full filename is
known as the absolute path(name) to the file - absolute because it
starts at the root of the system. With this nomenclature we are able to
move around the filesystem.</p>
<p>Similarly, relative pathnames are permissible, describing the route to
another path or directory from the current directory: the file
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">country.dat</span></tt> in the directory <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/home/plewis</span></tt> may be addressed
either absolutely as:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>/home/plewis/country.dat</div></blockquote>
<p>or relative to e.g. the directory <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/home/mdisney</span></tt> as:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>../plewis/country.dat</div></blockquote>
<p>where <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">..</span></tt> is a special symbol meaning ‘up one directory level’. An
analogy is the address of your next door neighbour’s house. If you
wanted to tell a friend what next door’s address is, you could give them
the house number, the street, the city, the post code, and even the
country. That’s the absolute path name to your neighbour’s house. Of
course it’s much easier to specify “one house up from mine” or “number
18” etc. This is the relative path (relative to yours).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="dot">
<h3>dot<a class="headerlink" href="#dot" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Since <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">..</span></tt> (dot-dot) means &#8216;up one level&#8217; in unix, we can also note at
this point that the symbol <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.</span></tt> (dot) means &#8216;the current directory&#8217;,
so:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>./country.dat</div></blockquote>
<p>would refer to a file called <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">country.dat</span></tt> that is in the current
directory.</p>

<div class="section" id="negotiating-the-file-system">
<h2>1.5 Negotiating the file system<a class="headerlink" href="#negotiating-the-file-system" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Each user in a UNIX network system has specific area of the filesystem
belonging to them known as their home directory in which they are
initially placed when they log on. Armed with a basic knowledge of the
structure of the filesystem, each user is free to explore and visit
almost any area of the system unless it has been specifically protected
by its owner.</p>
<div class="section" id="pwd">
<h3>pwd<a class="headerlink" href="#pwd" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A good place to start is to be aware of <em>where you are</em> in the current
shell.</p>
<p>When you opened your shell, you should normally be in your <em>home</em>
directory, which will be something like <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/home/fbloggs</span></tt> on our system
(if your username were fbloggs) (or on a mac, under OS X, it might be
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/Users/fbloggs</span></tt>).</p>
<p>The command to tell you where you are (in this shell) on the system is
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pwd</span></tt> (print working directory).</p>
<p>Try this for yourself now <strong>in a shell</strong> and confirm that this is the
case. Make sure to hit the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">return</span></tt> key to execute the command.</p>
<div class="code python highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">pwd</span>

<div class="section" id="twiddle">
<h3>twiddle<a class="headerlink" href="#twiddle" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The home directory is a special place ... it&#8217;s the part of the system
that you &#8216;own&#8217; and have control over.</p>
<p>There is a special symbol in unix (formally, the <em>tilde</em> symbol <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~</span></tt>,
though we often call it <em>twiddle</em>). In &#8216;<em>unix speak</em>&#8216; then we might
refer to the home directory of the user <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">plewis</span></tt> and &#8216;<em>twiddle
plewis</em>&#8216;, which we would write as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~plewis</span></tt>.</p>
<p>If you want to refer to your <em>own</em> home directory, you can shortcut this
to just &#8216;<em>twiddle</em>&#8216;, i.e. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~</span></tt>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cd">
<h3>cd<a class="headerlink" href="#cd" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>So, we know how to find out where we are. How do we get somewhere else
on the system?</p>
<p>To change your working directory to somewhere else, use the command
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cd</span></tt> (change directory).</p>
<p><em>Let&#8217;s use that now (in a shell) to change our working directory to the
root of the file system.</em></p>
<div class="code python highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>cd /
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>/
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>which will (once you hit the return key to execute the command) change
your location, your ‘working directory’ to the root directory <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/</span></tt>.</p>
<p>A few things to pay attention to when first coming across this:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>first, there is space (‘white space’ as we call it) between the
command cd and the ‘argument’ <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/</span></tt>. This is one or more spaces or
tab characters so that the shell can understand that you want to run
the command cd and give it some extra information (where to change
directory to in this case), rather than, for example typing <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cd/</span></tt>
in which case the shell will interpret <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cd/</span></tt> as the command you are
trying to run;</li>
<li>second, if you think about what you want to achieve with the command,
(change directory to somewhere) it should be quite apparent that
apart from the command, you also need to give the shell an indication
of where you want to go (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/</span></tt> here) so you (normally) will have to
type cd somewhere where somewhere is where you want to go. When you
are first using these commands, pausing and thinking about what you
want to achive is particularly important. Later, it will generally
become second nature (as when you learn any new language).</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, if you type e.g.:</p>
<div class="code python highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>cd usr/bin
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>/usr/bin
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You will change directory to the subdirectory <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">bin</span></tt> of the
subdirectory <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">usr</span></tt> of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/</span></tt>, which is the same as doing (using an
absolute pathname):</p>
<div class="code python highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">cd</span> <span class="o">/</span><span class="n">usr</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="nb">bin</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>/usr/bin
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>These look similar at first glance, but the second importantly has a
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/</span></tt> at the front of the directory name, and so is an absolute
pathname, whereas the first does not, so it is a relative pathname.</p>
<p>The idea should be simple and intuitive once you get the idea of / being
a separator and / being the top of the directory tree (the root
directory).</p>
<p>We can also practice using the symbol <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.</span></tt> (dot) at this point ... what
does the following command do? (hint: check which directory you are in,
run the command below, then chack again to see where you are).</p>
<div class="code python highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>cd .
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>/usr/bin
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ls">
<h3>ls<a class="headerlink" href="#ls" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The unix command to give a listing of files or directories is <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ls</span></tt>

<h2>2.1 Making and removing directories<a class="headerlink" href="#making-and-removing-directories" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="mkdir">
<h3>mkdir<a class="headerlink" href="#mkdir" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The command <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mkdir</span></tt> (make directory) is used to create (&#8216;make&#8217;) a
directory. You will want to do this to organise your files (e.g. put all
of the files for a practical in one place).</p>
<p>In the unix system you have here, there is (should be) a data directory
(called <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Data</span></tt> or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">DATA</span></tt>). This is a large storage disk that you can
use to put large exercises and data. Note that this disk is not so
regularly backed up as your home directory, but it is much larger (and
does not have a quota, as your home area does).</p>
<p>Lets first move to the data directory:</p>
<div class="code python highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>cd ~/Data
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>/Users/plewis/Data
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>and check where we are:</p>
<div class="code python highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">pwd</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="s">u&#39;/Users/plewis/Data&#39;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Now let&#8217;s create a directory that we might call foo, and move (i.e.
change directory) into it:</p>
<div class="code python highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>mkdir foo
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="code python highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>cd foo
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>/Users/plewis/Data/foo
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>or alternatively, to go straight there:</p>
<div class="code python highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>cd ~/Data/foo
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>/Users/plewis/Data/foo
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="code python highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">ls</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>There should be no files in this new directory, so ls will tell us that.</p>
<p>It is instructive to see what happens if we try to create a directory
that already exists:</p>
<div class="code python highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>mkdir ~/Data/foo
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>mkdir: /Users/plewis/Data/foo: File exists
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>So, the command <em>complains</em> that the file already exists.</p>
<p>If we want to avoid this behaviour and create it is it doesn&#8217;t exist or
just leave it if it already does, we can use the <em>command line option</em>
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-p</span></tt> for <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mkdir</span></tt>:</p>
<div class="code python highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>mkdir -p ~/Data/foo
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Command line options (that are normally preceeded by a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-</span></tt> character
or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--</span></tt> in some cases) change the behaviour of a command.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="rmdir">
<h3>rmdir<a class="headerlink" href="#rmdir" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Now suppose we don&#8217;t want the directory any more.</p>
<p>To remove an <em>empty</em> directory, we use the command <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">rmdir</span></tt> (remove
directory).</p>
<p>Its not a good idea to try to remove the directory we are in, so let&#8217;s
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cd</span></tt> home first:</p>
<div class="code python highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>cd ~
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>/Users/plewis
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="code python highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>rmdir ~/Data/foo
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="code python highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>ls ~/Data/

</div>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>brdf_WW_1_A_1.kernelFiltered.dat  [34moutput[m[m/

<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Using the command <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ls</span></tt> we should be able to confirm that the</div>

<p>directory has gone.
| Again, it is instructive to see what happens if things &#8216;go wrong&#8217;, so
let&#8217;s create a directory that is not empty, and try to use rmdir to
delete it:</p>
<div class="code python highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>mkdir -p ~/Data/foo/bar
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We can see that another use of the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-p</span></tt> option in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mkdir</span></tt> is to
allow us to create a hierarchy of directories at one shot, so now, in
the directory <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/Data/foo</span></tt> we have a sub-directory `~/Data/foo/bar&#8217;:</p>
<div class="code python highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>ls ~/Data/foo
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>[34mbar[m[m/
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="code python highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>rmdir ~/Data/foo
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>rmdir: /Users/plewis/Data/foo: Directory not empty
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>So, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">rmdir</span></tt> complains that the directory is not empty, and so doesn&#8217;t
delete it. We will see below that we use another command in this case.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="wildcards">
<h2>2.2 Wildcards<a class="headerlink" href="#wildcards" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Very often, we don&#8217;t want to have to refer to the <em>full</em> file or
directory name. Equally, we might often want to refer to multiple
filenames or directories.</p>
<p>To do this in unix, we use <em>wildcards</em>. The wildcard symbols are: <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">*</span></tt>
and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">?</span></tt>.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">*</span></tt> is interpreted as <em>zero or more characters</em> <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">?</span></tt> is a single
(wildcard) character</p>
<p>We use these to form <em>patterns</em> of filenames.</p>
<p>So, if we wanted to get a listing of all of the files in the directory
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~plewis/msc</span></tt> that end with the suffix <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.dat</span></tt> we would type:</p>
<div class="code python highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>ls ~plewis/msc/*.dat
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>/Users/plewis/msc/atm.dat         /Users/plewis/msc/helloWorld.dat

<h2>2.3 Copying, moving and deleting files<a class="headerlink" href="#copying-moving-and-deleting-files" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="cp">
<h3>cp<a class="headerlink" href="#cp" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The command for copying a file is <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cp</span></tt> (copy), e.g.:</p>
<div class="code python highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>mkdir -p ~/Data/foo
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="code python highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>cp -n ~plewis/msc/hello.dat ~/Data/foo
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>First, we created the directory ~/Data/foo, then we used the command cp
to copy a file from ~plewis/msc/hello.dat to the directory ~/Data/foo.</p>
<p>Usually you will be able to simply type:</p>
<p>cp ~plewis/msc/hello.dat ~/Data/foo</p>
<p>i.e. without the -n option we have put here, but on some systems /
setups you will find that cp might complain if one or more of the files
you are trying to copy to already exist (this is a safety mechanism to
stop you overwriting something you might not have meant to!).</p>
<p>The -n option makes cp copy the files, but not overwrite an existing
file.</p>
<p>Note that if cp detects an attempt to copy a file to itself, the copy
will fail.</p>
<p><strong>Check that the file has been correctly copied using an appropriate
command.</strong></p>
<p>Note the <em>whitespace</em> between the command <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cp</span></tt> and the two <em>arguments</em>
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~plewis/msc/hello.dat</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/Data/foo</span></tt>, as well as the use of the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-n</span></tt> option here.</p>
<p>A common mistake people make when first using this command is not giving
two (actually, two or more) arguments, but if you think about what
information you would need to give to the computer to copy a file from
somewhere to somewhere else, you will soon learn that you need at least
two arguments.</p>
<p>We can copy more than one file at a time using wildcard characters.</p>
<p>To explore this, lets get a listing of all of the files that end with
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.dat</span></tt> but start with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">h</span></tt> in the directory <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~plewis/msc</span></tt>:</p>
<div class="code python highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>ls ~plewis/msc/h*.dat
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>/Users/plewis/msc/head.dat        /Users/plewis/msc/hello.dat
/Users/plewis/msc/header.dat      /Users/plewis/msc/helloWorld.dat
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To copy multiple files to the same place then, we could simply list the
names:</p>
<div class="code python highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>cp -n ~plewis/msc/hello.dat ~plewis/msc/helloWorld.dat ~/Data/foo
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In this case, the command has three arguments. The final argument
(<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/Data/foo</span></tt>) is interpreted as the place we want to copy the files
<em>to</em>, and everything before that is a list of files we want to copy
there</p>
<p>If we knew we&#8217;d want all of the files <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">h*.dat</span></tt>, then we can more
simply type:</p>
<div class="code python highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>cp -n ~plewis/msc/h*.dat ~/Data/foo
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Again, after you have done this, check to see what files are in the
directory <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/Data/foo</span></tt>.</p>
<div class="code python highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>ls ~/Data/foo
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>[34mbar[m[m/            head.dat        header.dat      hello.dat       helloWorld.dat
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You can use the option -R to do a recursive copy, i.e. copy a directory
and everything below it, e.g.:</p>
<div class="code python highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>mkdir -p ~/Data/testCp
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="code python highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>cp -Rf ~plewis/msc ~/Data/testCp

<h3>rm<a class="headerlink" href="#rm" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The command <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">rm</span></tt> (remove) is used to remove (delete) a file. For new
users, we normally set the default behaviour of this (through something
called an <em>alias</em>) to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">rm</span> <span class="pre">-i</span></tt> which then prompts the user about
whether they <em>really</em> wanted to delete that file.</p>
<p>The opposite of this (i.e. force a delete) is <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">rm</span> <span class="pre">-f</span></tt> that we will
illustrate here.</p>
<div class="code python highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>rm -f ~/Data/foo/header.dat

</div>
<p>so we see the file has gone from that directory.</p>
<p><em>Normally</em>, especially when you are just starting to use unix, you
should probably avoid using the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-f</span></tt> option to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">rm</span></tt>.</p>
<p>As an exercise, use <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">rm</span></tt> and wildcards to delete all of the files in

</div>
<p>You can use the option <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-R</span></tt> to make <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">rm</span></tt> do a hierarchical
(&#8216;recursive&#8217;) deletion, e.g. delete everything from some directory
downwards.</p>
<p>This can be rather a dangerous command to use, as you might (if you are
not careful) delete everything on your system, but of course it is of
great practical use.</p>
<p>But we will use it here to delete the directory <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/Data/foo</span></tt> and all

<div class="code python highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>rm -Rf ~/Data/foo

<p>Let&#8217;s make a new directories <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/Data/bar</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/Data/foo</span></tt> and copy

<div class="code python highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>cp -n ~plewis/msc/h*dat ~/Data/bar

<h2>2.4 Getting more control<a class="headerlink" href="#getting-more-control" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>You should now have some understanding of the main unix commands for
dealing with directories and files.</p>
<p>We will now introduce a few concepts that give you more control over
what you are doing on the system.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Although in the examples above, we have been able to type some
basic system commands into the python, we can&#8217;t do this for some of the
commands we will use below. A more general interface to unix (shell)
commands from a python prompt involves putting an exclamation mark
(<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">!</span></tt>, known as <em>&#8216;bang&#8217;</em>) in front of the command. In these notes then,
where you see <em>bang</em> (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">!</span></tt>) in front of a command, you leave that out
when using the command at the unix prompt. e.g.:</p>
<div class="code python highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>!ls ~/Data/foo
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>hello.dat      helloWorld.dat
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You can also run shell commands by invoking the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">bash</span></tt> shell:</p>
<div class="code python highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>ls ~/Data/foo
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">hello</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">dat</span>
<span class="n">helloWorld</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">dat</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="quota">
<h3>quota<a class="headerlink" href="#quota" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We mentioned above that your home directories have a quota associated
with them. This means that when you try to go over that quota, you will
no longer be able to write to your home area.</p>
<p>This can be a cause of confusion with new students, in particular
because when you log into to a windowing session on the unix computers,
several files tend to be written to your user area on startup. So, if
you are over your quota, you will find that your attempt to login fails.
This can be confusing because you may just imagine that the system is
&#8216;broken&#8217;, or perhaps you have typed the wrong password. These are things
that <em>can</em> happen of course, but by far the most common reason for your
being unable to log in to a windowing session (and probably somethiong
that will happen to most of you at some point over the year) is that you
have gone over your quota.</p>
<p>The unix command to check your quota is, helpfully, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">quota</span></tt>, though
you would usually use the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-v</span></tt> option:</p>
<div class="code python highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">quota</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">v</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>Disk quotas for user plewis (uid 501): none
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>dyld: DYLD_ environment variables being ignored because main executable (/usr/bin/quota) is setuid or setgid
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If you happen to be on a system where no quota is set (e.g. your own
computer), this command will tell you that.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ssh">
<h3>ssh<a class="headerlink" href="#ssh" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>That&#8217;s all very well to be able to find out if you are over your quota,
but how can you do that if you can&#8217;t log in?</p>
<p>Well, in that case, you need to find another terminal somewhere (e.g.
&#8216;borrow&#8217; a window on another user&#8217;s display, with their permission) and
you can check it from there.</p>
<p>One way to do this is to use the command <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ssh</span></tt> which you can use to
spawn a process on a remote machine.</p>
<p>For example, you have tried to log in to a computer called
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">berlin.geog.ucl.ac.uk</span></tt> but the login fails. You then go to a friend
who is logged in to another computer and ask if you can check your quota
from there. You open a new terminal, and use <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ssh</span></tt> (secure shell):</p>
<div class="code bash highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>ssh plewis@berlin.geog.ucl.ac.uk &quot;quota -v&quot;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>which will then prompt you for your password and return the result of
running the command <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">quota</span> <span class="pre">-v</span></tt> on the computer
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">berlin.geog.ucl.ac.uk</span></tt> as the user <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">plewis</span></tt> (obviously, you replace
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">plewis</span></tt> by your user name).</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you just type:</p>
<div class="code bash highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>ssh plewis@berlin.geog.ucl.ac.uk
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Then this will start an interactive session as the user <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">plewis</span></tt> (or
rather, your username) on that computer and you should then be able to
check your quota and fix any issues you have.</p>
<p>We will see some further use of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ssh</span></tt> later on, but knowing that you
can use it to run a remote process is very useful.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="df">
<h3>df<a class="headerlink" href="#df" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If you are using large datasets (that you may easily be doing in remote
sensing), then you should have some awareness of how much space there is
on the disk. If a disk gets full or nearly full, and you attempt to
write to it, you may get unexpected results. You may also waste a lot of
time.</p>
<p>The command <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">df</span></tt> (disk free) will also tell you how much disk space
there is, and how much is used. It is generally of value to use the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-h</span></tt> option that gives the results in &#8216;human readable&#8217; form e.g.:</p>
<div class="code python highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>df -h ~/Data
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>Filesystem     Size   Used  Avail Capacity   iused    ifree %iused  Mounted on

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The output of this command is also of value to you if you need to know
the actual device name of some disk area. For example, what you see on
the file system as e.g. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/Data</span></tt> may be physically on a device called
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/dev/disk0s2</span></tt>. Mostly, you won&#8217;t need to know that level of detail
about the system, but occasionally, and as you become more expert in
using unix, you will so it is good to have these things at the back of
your mind.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="du">
<h3>du<a class="headerlink" href="#du" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>To check how much disk space <em>you are using</em>, use the command <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">du</span></tt>
(disk usage). Often, you would use this with the option <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-s</span></tt> which
produces a summary. Again, it is often of value to use the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-h</span></tt> option
that gives the results in &#8216;human readable&#8217; form e.g.:</p>
<div class="code python highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>du -sh ~/Data
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>4.7M        /Users/plewis/Data
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This summary disk usage information tells us (here in human readbale
form) how much disk space is used in the directory <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/Data</span></tt> and its
subdirectories.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ls-l">
<h3>ls -l<a class="headerlink" href="#ls-l" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We have come across the command <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ls</span></tt> earlier as the command to give a
listing of directory contents.</p>
<p>A useful option for the command <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ls</span></tt> that gives you a <em>long</em> (verbose)
listing of files or directories is <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ls</span> <span class="pre">-l</span></tt> (long listing).</p>
<p>We will first make move the directory <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/Data/bar</span></tt> into the directory
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/Data/foo</span></tt>, then look at a long listing of what there is in
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/Data/foo</span></tt>:</p>
<div class="code python highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>mv ~/Data/bar ~/Data/foo
ls -l ~/Data/foo
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>total 16

-rw-r--r--  1 plewis  staff   13  1 Oct 14:53 helloWorld.dat
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The long listing displays information on the owner of a file (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">plewis</span></tt>
here), the size of the file (e.g. ~/Data/foo/hello.dat is 14 bytes), and
when it was last modified (26 Sep 17:05). The first field that you see
(e.g. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">drwxr-xr-x</span></tt>) is a series of codes that tells you about what
type of file it is (d in the first element means that it is a directory)
then there are three sets of three elements that may be set to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">rwx</span></tt>
or unset as in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">---</span></tt>. These refer to read <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">r</span></tt>, write <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">w</span></tt> and
execute <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">x</span></tt> permissions for this file (or directory), so that if you
see e.g. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">rw-</span></tt> that means that read and write permission are set but
not execute. Note that directories have the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">x</span></tt> bit set if you are to
be able to see into that directory, but you will not generally alter
that.</p>
<p>The three groupings refer to <em>user</em> <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">u</span></tt>, <em>group</em> <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">g</span></tt> and <em>other</em>
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">o</span></tt>.</p>
<p>A useful additional option to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ls</span></tt> is the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-h</span></tt> option, that gives
file sizes in &#8216;human readable&#8217; format (i.e. something easier to
understand):</p>
<div class="code python highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>ls -lh ~/Data/foo
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>total 16

-rw-r--r--  1 plewis  staff    13B  1 Oct 14:53 helloWorld.dat
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>where the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">B</span></tt> at the end of the size field tells us the size is in
bytes (or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">K</span></tt> for Kilobytes, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">M</span></tt> for Megabytes, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">G</span></tt> for Gigabytes
etc).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="chmod">
<h3>chmod<a class="headerlink" href="#chmod" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>So, using <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ls</span> <span class="pre">-l</span></tt> give us information on what the file (/directory)
permissions are. By default this will tend to be a sensible but open
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-rw-r--r--</span></tt> for files, i.e. read permission for the user, groups and
the rest of the world but only write permission for the user themselves.
For directories, the default is generally similar, but the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">x</span></tt> bit is
set as well.</p>
<p>We can manipulate the file permission settings, e.g. to remove read
permission for some secure piece of work we are doing, or to open up
write permission for other users on some shared piece of work, using the
command <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">chmod</span></tt> (change mode).</p>
<p>If you have followed the material above, you should have a file called
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">hello.dat</span></tt> in the directory <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/Data/foo</span></tt> (check that this is the
case) and we will make a new sub-directory in there called <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">foobar</span></tt>
from which we will <em>remove</em> all write permissions.</p>
<div class="code python highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>mkdir -p ~/Data/foo/foobar

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>From which we see that the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">w</span></tt> bit on the directory
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/Data/foo/foobar</span></tt> has been removed (unset). The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">uog</span></tt> part refers
to <em>user</em>, <em>group</em> and <em>other</em>. The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-</span></tt> part means <em>remove</em> and the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">w</span></tt> part refers to the write bit.</p>
<p>So, if we now try to copy or move a file into the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">bar</span></tt> directory, we
would expect it to fail:</p>
<div class="code python highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>cp -f ~/Data/foo/hello.dat ~/Data/foo/foobar

<h2>2.5 Exercise<a class="headerlink" href="#exercise" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Go through the notes above, making sure you understand how to create and
remove files and directories and how to move around the file system.
That is the <em>minimum</em> you will need to start with. When you are doing
this, <strong>don&#8217;t</strong> just blindly type the commands given above, vary the
file and directory names and make sure you appreciate what each command
you type is doing (otherwise you won&#8217;t learn this, I&#8217;m afraid).</p>
<p>You should pay some attention to the notes on <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">quota</span></tt> and related disk
space/usage commands, as it is really quite likely that you will hit
such problems at some time in the year, and you really ought to be able
to fix such problems yourself. Remember, if you can&#8217;t log on, the most
likely reasons are: (i) you typed something wrong (so, check carefully);
(ii) if you can&#8217;t get in at the desktop, then probably you have gone
over your quota. The most likely reason for going over quota is that you
have put too many large files in your home area, instead of putting them

above and delete the files from your home area until you are below
quota, <em>or</em> (better) move them into the <em>Data</em> area (or better still,
put them in the <em>Data</em> area in the first place and avoid this problem).</p>

<h2>3.1 UNIX Command Structure, Data Flow and File Manipulation<a class="headerlink" href="#unix-command-structure-data-flow-and-file-manipulation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The previous sections dealt with the basic tools of Unix. Now, we will
look at a few useful tools you have access to and some slightly more
advanced concepts that again enable you to do more with the computer.</p>
<p>Before starting this section, let&#8217;s create a directory in your <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Data</span></tt>
area called <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">unix</span></tt>:</p>
<div class="code python highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>mkdir -p ~/Data/unix
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Remember that commands below that start with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">!</span></tt> (bang) should not
have this symbol when you type them at the unix prompt: it is only
because we are going through a python interpreter in these notes.</p>
<div class="section" id="streams">
<h3>streams<a class="headerlink" href="#streams" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Within unix all information is stored in files. Programs are &#8216;told&#8217; (by
the operating system) to read from and write to these files either by
redirecting their input and output, or by modifying their action through
the use of command line arguments or options. The channels through which
the data flows to or from are known as <em>streams</em>.</p>
<p>In the special case where data flows directly from one program into
another, these channels are known as <em>pipes</em>.</p>
<p>By default, with no options or arguments to specify otherwise, most
commands will read their input form the keyboard and write their output
to the screen. The data channels which attach the keyboard and the
screen to the program are known as the standard input (stdin) and the
standard output (stdout) respectively.</p>
<p>Stdin and stdout can be redirected to and from files rather than the
keyboard or screen using the unix <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;</span></tt> (“read from&#8221;) and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&gt;</span></tt> (“write
to”) symbols.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="echo">
<h3>echo<a class="headerlink" href="#echo" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The <em>shell</em> command <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">echo</span></tt> will display text that you type after the
command in the terminal (by default), e.g.:</p>
<div class="code python highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>echo &quot;my home is $HOME and my name is $USER&quot;
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>my home is /Users/plewis and my name is plewis
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Here, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">HOME</span></tt> is an <em>environment variable</em> that is passed through to
programs to give contextual information about a users&#8217;s environment
(i.e. how things are set up).</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">USER</span></tt> is another environment variable that gives your username
(&#8216;login&#8217; or &#8216;account&#8217; name).</p>
<p>In unix shells, we refer to the <em>value</em> of an environment variable with
a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">$</span></tt> symbol. Environment variables tend to be in upper case (capital
letters) whereas another type of variable, shell variables (that refer
only to a particular shell) are in lower case (small letters).</p>
<p>Often, we would put quotes around the text:</p>
<div class="code python highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>echo &quot;hello world $USER&quot;
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>hello world plewis
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This makes it a bit neater to see what we are doing, but is not strictly
necessary in this case.</p>
<p>There are different quotes that we use in unix. The double quote <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&quot;</span></tt>
allows shell variables to be interpreted in the <em>string</em> enclosed by the
quotes, but a single quote <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">'</span></tt> does not.</p>
<div class="code python highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>echo &#39;hello world $USER&#39;
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>hello world $USER
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="stdout">
<h3>stdout<a class="headerlink" href="#stdout" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>So, when we use the unix command <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">echo</span></tt>, the <em>result</em> of running that
command appears in the terminal we are using.</p>
<p>In fact, it is directed to the standard output channel <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">stdout</span></tt>, which
allows us to redirect it, e.g. to a file:</p>
<div class="code python highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>echo &quot;hello world&quot; &gt; ~/Data/unix/hello.dat
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Now, nothing should have appeared in the terminal ... the text resulting
from the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">echo</span></tt> command went instead to the file
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/Data/unix/hello.dat</span></tt>.</p>
<p>We can check to see how big this file is to see if that makes sense:</p>
<div class="code python highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>ls -lh ~/Data/unix/hello.dat
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>-rw-r--r--  1 plewis  staff    12B  1 Oct 14:53 /Users/plewis/Data/unix/hello.dat
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We see that the file <em>exists</em> and is of size 12 bytes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="wc">
<h3>wc<a class="headerlink" href="#wc" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We could count up the number of characters in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&quot;hello</span> <span class="pre">world&quot;</span></tt> and see
that it has 11 (including the space). We might infer from that that the
file representation uses 1 byte per character for text, which is in fact
the case. The <em>encoding</em> used is normally the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">ASCII character
set</a>.</p>
<p>Why is the file 12 bytes though? The answer is that there is an
additional character at the end of the file that tells the operating
system that this is the end of the file. Not surprisingly, this is
called the end of file marker or more properly, end of transmission
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">EOT</span></tt>. This is represented as by the character <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">^D</span></tt> (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">control</span> <span class="pre">D</span></tt>)
in the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">ASCII character set</a>.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&#8217;s too much effort to count up the characters in a string or
a file. In unix, we can use the command <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">wc</span></tt> (word count):</p>
<div class="code python highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>wc &lt; ~/Data/unix/hello.dat
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>1       2      12
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>By default, this displays the number of <em>lines</em> (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">1</span></tt> here), <em>words</em>
(<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">2</span></tt> here) and <em>bytes</em> (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">12</span></tt> here) in the file.</p>
<p>Useful modifcations of behaviour are e.g.:</p>
<div class="code python highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>wc -l &lt; ~/Data/unix/hello.dat
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="mi">1</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>which reports only the number of lines (similarly <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">wc</span> <span class="pre">-w</span></tt> for words or
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">wc</span> <span class="pre">-c</span></tt> for characters).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="stdin">
<h3>stdin<a class="headerlink" href="#stdin" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>You may have noticed that we used the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">stdin</span></tt> symbol <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;</span></tt> here, which
redirects the contents of the file <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/Data/unix/hello.dat</span></tt> <em>into</em> the
command <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">wc</span></tt>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pipe">
<h3>pipe<a class="headerlink" href="#pipe" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>One powerful concept in unix is the idea of <em>pipes</em>. This allows us to
take the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">stdout</span></tt> resulting from one program and direct it to the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">stdin</span></tt> of another.</p>
<p>This means we can e.g. avoid writing files out where all we want to do
with the information is to pass it to another program.</p>
<p>So, for the examples above, we could write:</p>
<div class="code python highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>echo &quot;hello world&quot; | wc -c
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="mi">12</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>where <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">|</span></tt> is the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pipe</span></tt> symbol.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sed">
<h3>sed<a class="headerlink" href="#sed" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This sort of idea is very useful if a sequence of programs (unix
commands) that you want to run essentially work as &#8216;filters&#8217;.</p>
<p>The command <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sed</span></tt> (stream editor) can be very useful in this regard
for dealing with text. The syntax of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sed</span></tt> can be a little awkward for
users to begin with, but we will just show a few examples here.</p>
<div class="code python highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>echo &quot;welcome $USER to using a computer&quot;
echo &quot;welcome $USER to using a computer&quot; | sed &#39;s/a computer/unix/&#39;
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>welcome plewis to using a computer
welcome plewis to using unix
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">s</span></tt> part of the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sed</span></tt> command means &#8216;substitute&#8217;. It then
changes an occurrence of the string <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">computer</span></tt> into the string
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">unix</span></tt>.</p>
<p>If you wanted to change <em>all</em> occurrences of the string, use a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">g</span></tt> at
the end, e.g.:</p>
<div class="code python highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>echo &quot;welcome $USER to using a computer. How do you like using a computer?&quot; | sed &#39;s/a computer/unix/&#39;
echo &quot;welcome $USER to using a computer. How do you like using a computer?&quot; | sed &#39;s/a computer/unix/g&#39;
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>welcome plewis to using unix. How do you like using a computer?
welcome plewis to using unix. How do you like using unix?

</div>
<div class="section" id="awk">
<h3>awk<a class="headerlink" href="#awk" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>You are not limited to a single pipe of course, but can pipe through
multiple commands.</p>
<p>To illustrate this, we introduce a new command awk that is a pattern
scanning and interpretation language. You can use awk (or variants such
as nawk or gawk) for many things but it is particularly useful for doing
operations on columns of text or data that are in ASCII (i.e. text)
format. For example:</p>
<div class="code python highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>echo &quot;1 2 3 4 5&quot; | awk &#39;{print $1+$3}&#39;
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="mi">4</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>will output the sum of numbers in columns 1 and 3. To use it below, we
can note here that the term <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">$0</span></tt> refers to the complete input string
and that there is a reasonably rich syntax for performing operations on
columsn of data.</p>
<div class="code python highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>echo &quot;1 2 3 4 5&quot;
echo &quot;1 2 3 4 5&quot; | awk &#39;{for(i=1;i&lt;=NF;i++)sum+=$i} END{print &quot;the sum is&quot;,sum}&#39;
echo &quot;1 2 3 4 5&quot; | sed &#39;s/1/one/&#39;
echo &quot;1 2 3 4 5&quot; | sed &#39;s/1/one/&#39; | sed &#39;s/2/two/&#39; | sed &#39;s/3/three/&#39; | sed &#39;s/4/four/&#39; \
                         | sed &#39;s/5/five/&#39; | awk &#39;{print $0 &quot;, once I caught a fish alive&quot;}&#39;

<h3>cat<a class="headerlink" href="#cat" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The unix command <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cat</span></tt> (concatenate) is used for a variety of
purposes, but normally you will use it to <em>concatenate</em> (join together)
files.</p>
<p>If you specify a filename as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-</span></tt> then the information of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">stdin</span></tt> is

<p>Here, we ran the command <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">date</span></tt> that prints the current date (time) to

<h3>grep<a class="headerlink" href="#grep" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Another very useful utility is grep (&#8216;globally search a regular
expression and print&#8217;). You will commonly use this to find lines in a
file that match some pattern. E.g.:</p>
<div class="code python highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>grep see &lt; ~/Data/unix/test.dat
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>Now you see me
now you still see me
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We told <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">grep</span></tt> to return (i.e. put on <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">stdout</span></tt>) lines of input that
contain the string <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">see</span></tt> in this case.</p>
<p>By default, the pattern we search for is case sensitive (so, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Now</span></tt> is
different from <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">now</span></tt>).</p>
<p>We can use the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-v</span></tt> option to ignore the case (i.e. whether it is
lower case or upper case):</p>
<div class="code python highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>grep now &lt; ~/Data/unix/test.dat
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>now you still see me

</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>Now you see me
now you still see me
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Usefully, we can also return lines that <em>don&#8217;t</em> match the pattern using
the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-v</span></tt> option:</p>
<div class="code python highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>grep -v see &lt; ~/Data/unix/test.dat

<h2>3.2 Creating and editing text files<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-and-editing-text-files" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A common thing you will want to do is create or edit a text file (ASCII
text file).</p>
<p>We have seen that you can redirect the standard output of unix commands
to a file, so if the commands output ASCII, this is obviously one way
you can create a file.</p>
<p>We have also mentioned that the default input for <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">stdin</span></tt> is what you
type at the keyboard, so we can use that to create some text in a file.</p>
<p>We can use the command <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cat</span></tt> for this.</p>
<p>If you type <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cat</span></tt> at the prompt:</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">%berlin</span> <span class="pre">cat</span></tt></p>
<p>then what you type after that will be read into <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cat</span></tt> and sent to
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">stdout</span></tt>.</p>
<p>Try that now.</p>
<p>To end the input (end the file) we type a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">^D</span></tt> character (the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">control</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">D</span></tt> keys together).</p>
<p>for example, type or copy and paste some text such as:</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">%berlin</span> <span class="pre">cat</span> <span class="pre">Gallia</span> <span class="pre">est</span> <span class="pre">omnis</span> <span class="pre">divisa</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">partes</span> <span class="pre">tres;</span> <span class="pre">unam</span> <span class="pre">partem</span> <span class="pre">incolunt</span> <span class="pre">Belgae,</span> <span class="pre">aliam</span> <span class="pre">Aquitani,</span> <span class="pre">tertiam</span> <span class="pre">qui</span> <span class="pre">ipsorum</span> <span class="pre">lingua</span> <span class="pre">Celtae,</span> <span class="pre">nostra</span> <span class="pre">Galli,</span> <span class="pre">appellantur.</span> <span class="pre">^D</span></tt></p>
<p>You should find that the lines you type are &#8216;echoed&#8217; to the terminal
when you hit <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">return</span></tt> at the end of each line. This is because you are
sending information to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cat</span></tt> from the keyboard (visualised in the
terminal so you can see what you are typing) on <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">stdin</span></tt> and the output
is also going to the terminal on <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">stdout</span></tt>.</p>
<p>If you wanted to type information that will go into a file, you can
redirect the output of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cat</span></tt> to a file:</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">%berlin</span> <span class="pre">cat</span> <span class="pre">&gt;</span> <span class="pre">~/Data/unix/gettysburg.dat</span> <span class="pre">The</span> <span class="pre">world</span> <span class="pre">will</span> <span class="pre">little</span> <span class="pre">note,</span>&nbsp; <span class="pre">nor</span> <span class="pre">long</span> <span class="pre">remember</span> <span class="pre">what</span> <span class="pre">we</span> <span class="pre">say</span> <span class="pre">here,</span>&nbsp; <span class="pre">but</span> <span class="pre">it</span> <span class="pre">can</span> <span class="pre">never</span> <span class="pre">forget</span> <span class="pre">what</span> <span class="pre">they</span> <span class="pre">did</span> <span class="pre">here.</span> <span class="pre">^D</span></tt></p>
<p>This will now be stored in the file <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/Data/unix/gettysburg.dat</span></tt>.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all very well, and often you will use this methbod to create some
text in a file, but if you make a mistake, you will find that you can&#8217;t
easily edit it, which can be rather inconvenient.</p>
<p>There are many text editors available for unix, and what you use
day-to-day will depend a lot on personal preferences.</p>
<p>A short tutorial introducing some of these is available
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/profLewis/geogg122/blob/master/Text%20processing.pdf?raw=true">here</a>.</p>
<p>Most of these will open a new &#8216;window&#8217;, which will then have buttons and
menus and other convenient gizmos, much like a word processor. Although
you obviously <em>can</em> type and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">process</span></tt> <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">words</span></tt> in such tools, you
should remember that these are <em>not</em> really the same as word processors
as the aim is to type and manipulate text represented as ASCII
characters (i.e. not in MS word or rtf format or whatever). That said,
some texteditors <em>can</em> store files in formats other than ASCII (e.g.
rtf), and also some word processing formats are simply ASCII text
representations.</p>
<div class="section" id="vi">
<h3>vi<a class="headerlink" href="#vi" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In these notes and the associated lecture, we will introduce you to one
of the <strong>most basic</strong> unix text editors, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">vi</span></tt> (which is similar to its
varaint <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">vim</span></tt> that you will sometimes come across).</p>
<p>Whilst there is some learning overhead on this, two very good reasons
for knowing the bare bones of this are:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>it is available on <em>any</em> unix system</li>
<li>you use it through a terminal, so it doesn&#8217;t require any windowing
system</li>
</ol>
<p>This latter point could become important to you e.g. if you had broken
or corrupted your unix installation or e.g. if you were working remotely
over a connection that was slow.</p>
<p>It is worthwhile then learning these basics,but you can also follow a
good short tutorial on this called <a class="reference external" href="http://jerrywang.net/vi/">vi for
smarties</a>.</p>

<div class="section" id="foreground">
<h3>foreground<a class="headerlink" href="#foreground" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When you start a process that opens another window, you may have noticed
that no prompt was returned and that any subsequent typing in the parent
window was ignored until you exited the command (or it finished some
other way). This was because tool you started has taken over input to
and output from the parent window, or more accurately, the shell running
the window. In this state the program you started is said to be running
in the foreground - that is no further processes can be started from
that window/shell until textedit relinquishes control.</p>
<p>As an example, try:</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">berlin%</span> <span class="pre">display</span> <span class="pre">~plewis/msc/sar.jpg</span></tt></p>
<p>This should open a window on your computer and display a SAR image (of
Barton Bendish in Norfolk).</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="" src="Chapter1_Unix/files/images/sar.jpg" />
</div>
<p>The problem you will find is that if you go back to the terminal you ran
the command from, you will now longer be able to run any other commands.</p>
<p>Try typing <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ls</span></tt> for example, your terminal will <em>seem</em> to be &#8216;stuck&#8217;:</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">berlin%</span> <span class="pre">display</span> <span class="pre">~plewis/msc/sar.jpg</span> <span class="pre">ls</span></tt></p>
<p>The reason for this is that the terminal will not accept any further
commands until you quit the current process (or job, we might call it),
which is <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">xv</span></tt> here.</p>
<p>Quit <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">display</span></tt> by using the menu.</p>
<p>Now, any commands that you had stacked up will run ... which probably
isn&#8217;t what you wanted to happen.</p>
<p>When we run a process in this way, we say that it is in the
<em>foreground</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="background">
<h3>background<a class="headerlink" href="#background" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Sometimes then, we want to run a job in the <em>background</em>. This
effectively means that the process will run independently of the shell,
which means that the shell prompt will be freed up for further commands.</p>
<p>We do this by putting an ampersand (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&amp;</span></tt>) at the end of the command:</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">berlin%</span> <span class="pre">display</span> <span class="pre">~plewis/msc/sar.jpg</span> <span class="pre">&amp;</span> <span class="pre">berlin%</span></tt></p>
<p>And now you should see the command line prompt appear again (so you can
nbow type <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ls</span></tt> if thats what you wanted to do).</p>
<p>You should also have notices something else appearing which would be
something like:</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">[1]</span> <span class="pre">3568</span></tt></p>
<p>The [n] indicates this is the nth job to be started in this shell, and n
is the unique job number by which the process may be referenced within
that shell (window). The second number on the line (3568) is known as
the process ID (PID) of the program. This is the number by which the
central processor of the workstation refers to the job. This number is
unique to the program you have started, and may be used in any window to
refer to this process, as will be see.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="bg">
<h3>bg<a class="headerlink" href="#bg" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If the process you wish to place in the background is already running,
it can be stopped using <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">^Z</span></tt> (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Control</span> <span class="pre">Z</span></tt>).</p>
<p>The prompt will then return, and the job is placed in the background
using the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">bg</span></tt> command (note: all <em>you</em> type here (after typing
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">display</span> <span class="pre">~plewis/msc/sar.jpg</span></tt>) is <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">^Z</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">bg</span></tt>):</p>

<p>Whenever a job that will either use a lot of the machines processing
power (such as an image processing command) or take a long time to run
is started, it must be ‘nice’d up’. That is, the priority of the job
must be set so that other users can make use of the workstation whilst
your job is running. This is achieved using either the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">renice</span></tt>
command, as above, or preferably by using the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">nice</span></tt> command as the
job is started:</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">berlin%</span> <span class="pre">nice</span> <span class="pre">+19</span> <span class="pre">xv</span> <span class="pre">~plewis/msc/sar.jpg</span> <span class="pre">&amp;</span> <span class="pre">[2]</span> <span class="pre">3610</span></tt></p>
<p>This starts <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">xv</span></tt> in the background, and sets its priority to allow
fair use of the machine by other people. In fact, xv is not a process
that would normally need to be niced, as, unless image processing
operations are being performed it usually takes virtually no processing
power. It is used here simply as an example.</p>

machine e.g. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">shankly.geog.ucl.ac.uk</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cd</span></tt> to where the files are

<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">berlin%</span> <span class="pre">sftp</span> <span class="pre">shankly.geog.ucl.ac.uk</span></tt></p>
<p>at which point you will normally be prompted for a password. If the

<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">berlin%</span> <span class="pre">sftp</span> <span class="pre">plewis&#64;shankly.geog.ucl.ac.uk</span></tt></p>

set</a> within <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sftp</span></tt> to change

<p>Use <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">exit</span></tt> to exit the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sftp</span></tt> session.</p>

<div class="section" id="scp">
<h3>scp<a class="headerlink" href="#scp" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Sometimes, it is convenient to use <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">scp</span></tt>, a secure copy command that
you can use over digfferent machines on the network when they do not
have common disk access. The syntax is of the form:</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">scp</span> <span class="pre">plewis&#64;shankly.geog.ucl.ac.uk:///home/plewis/msc/hello.dat</span> <span class="pre">~/Data/helloLewis.dat</span></tt></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id8">
<h3>ssh<a class="headerlink" href="#id8" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Securely connect (‘log in’) to a shell on a remote computer. To set up
an interactive session, from a terminal or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ssh</span></tt> client type:</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">home%</span> <span class="pre">ssh</span> <span class="pre">plewis&#64;shankly.geog.ucl.ac.uk</span></tt></p>
<p>and respond to any confirmation request (the first time you connect two
machines) and the request for your password.</p>
<p>If you wish to run a session that uses X11, you need to set X11
tunneling:</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">home%</span> <span class="pre">ssh</span> <span class="pre">-X</span> <span class="pre">plewis&#64;shankly.geog.ucl.ac.uk</span></tt></p>
<p>on most unix/linux machines, or:</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">home%</span> <span class="pre">ssh</span> <span class="pre">-Y</span> <span class="pre">ucfaabc&#64;shankly.geog.ucl.ac.uk</span></tt></p>
<p>from OS X.</p>
<p>From a Windows machine, you should be able to connect using a client
such as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">putty</span></tt>, but this does not directly allow <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">X11</span></tt> sessions. To
do that, you need some <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">X11</span></tt> software (on the Windows machine) such as
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">exceed</span></tt>. You can purchase that software, or at no cost, use a WTS
session (see above) to start up
<a class="reference external" href="http://faq.rutgers.edu/?q=node/836">exceed</a> and then use e.g.
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">putty</span></tt> (or tools in exceed) with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">X11</span></tt> forwarding.</p>
<p>There are several alternatives to this from a Windows machine, one of
which is to set up a unix environment within windows using <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cygwin</span></tt>
but that might be too complex for novice users.</p>
<p>Another is to make your Windows computer dual boot and install a linux
system such as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ubuntu</span></tt> on it.</p>
<p>Yet another is to run linux as a virtual machine on top of Windows (or
the other way around!).</p>
<p>Another alternative is <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Xming</span></tt> that will run X11 on top of windows.</p>
<p>Please note that whilst there are all of these potential solutions, we
do not endorse or provide support for any particular solution. If you
want to be able to do this and think it would be useful, try it out
yourself and use the internet for resources to help you solve any
problems you come across. If you have particular problems you think are
connected with the UCL end of things, you can try asking the Geography
System Manager, or ISD (if it is a UCL issue), or at a push, Professor
Lewis in his office hours.</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong>: Note that you cannot use <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ssh</span></tt> (or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sftp</span></tt>) to connect
to <em>any</em> of the UCL Geography computers, as we only have a small number
open to the UCL firewall (such as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">shankly.geog.ucl.ac.uk</span></tt>) and the
machines we do have open are not ones you would normally want to do any
processing on (or at least, we don’t want everyone processing on these
gateway machines, as noone else will be able to get in).</p>
<p>You will normally have to use <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ssh</span></tt> to get on to one of these firewall
gateway machines, then <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ssh</span></tt> (normally <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ssh</span> <span class="pre">-X</span></tt> if you want to
maintain X11 port forwarding) from there to a machine (e.g. one in the
classroom) to do any processing. This might seem a little ‘roundabout’,
but you will soon get used to it and it is like this for good security
reasons.</p>
<p>N.B. if your username is different on the two machines, use e.g.
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ssh</span> <span class="pre">-X</span> <span class="pre">ucfaabc&#64;socrates.ucl.ac.uk</span></tt> or
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ssh</span> <span class="pre">-X</span> <span class="pre">socrates.ucl.ac.uk</span> <span class="pre">-l</span> <span class="pre">ucfaabc</span></tt> to give the correct username
for the remote machine (the one you are trying to log on to), otherwise
you can just use <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ssh</span> <span class="pre">-X</span> <span class="pre">socrates.ucl.ac.uk</span></tt>.</p>
<p>Once you (think you have) established a remote session with X11, you
should test it out, trying to open a simple application such as
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">xclock</span></tt> or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">xv</span></tt> or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">xeyes</span></tt> from the remote machine onto your
local machine.</p>
<p>If you are sure you are on a secure machine, you can set things up so
that you don’t have to keep typing the password when you connect (see
here) but remember that anybody else will be able to connect those
machines without a password.</p>
<p>Finally, if what you want to do with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ssh</span></tt> is not to run an
interactive session, but to run a process on the remote machine (e.g.
for some parallel processing), then you would normally use <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ssh</span> <span class="pre">-f</span></tt>
for this, with the option <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-X</span></tt> (or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-Y</span></tt> for OS X) if the processing
requires <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">X11</span></tt>. A simple example would be, get a listing of your home
directory:</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">home%</span> <span class="pre">ssh</span> <span class="pre">-f</span> <span class="pre">ucfaabc&#64;shankly.geog.ucl.ac.uk</span> <span class="pre">&quot;ls</span> <span class="pre">-l</span> <span class="pre">/home/plewis&quot;</span></tt></p>
<p>This will execute the sequence of commands in quotes on the remote
machine, then, when completed, terminate the session (that is what the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-f</span></tt> flag does). If you want to ssh from that machine onto another (to
run a process) that is a little more involved.</p>
<p>One way to do this would be e.g.:</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">home%</span> <span class="pre">ssh</span> <span class="pre">-f</span> <span class="pre">shankly.geog.ucl.ac.uk</span> <span class="pre">'ssh</span> <span class="pre">-f</span> <span class="pre">berlin.geog.ucl.ac.uk</span> <span class="pre">&quot;uname</span> <span class="pre">-a;pwd;</span> <span class="pre">cd</span> <span class="pre">/home/plewis</span> <span class="pre">;</span> <span class="pre">ls</span> <span class="pre">-l&quot;'</span></tt></p>
<p>which will <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ssh</span></tt> onto <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">shankly.geog.ucl.ac.uk</span></tt> and from there run an
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ssh</span></tt> process onto <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">berlin</span></tt> and then run the requested sequence of
commands. Note that in this case you will have needed to previously
ssh&#8217;d from <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">shankly</span></tt> to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">berlin</span></tt> to have responded to the
authentification request. This is a littler convoluted, especially the
use of quotes here but is it feasible and sometimes useful to do this.
You are much more likely to make use of this sort of command directly
from within the UCL Geography system, in which case you do not need
multiple levels of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ssh</span></tt> calls to get through the firewall.</p>

<h2>3.6 Exercise<a class="headerlink" href="#id9" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This final section covers a bit more than the basics of unix, and in
that sense, is a bit more than what we consider <em>critical</em> for you in
this class. If you <em>do</em> learn these few other commands though, you
should (hopefully) feel empowered to do more with your computers and get
some real control over whats going on (rather than just clicking a
button or sliding a slider).</p>
<p>As a follow up to this section, you could try to see if you can access
the unix system from outside of the lab and copy files to and from
another computer.</p>
<p>You might also like to look at further command line options for some of
these commands. Mostly, there is a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--help</span></tt> option (e.g.
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ls</span> <span class="pre">--help</span></tt>) that you can use. You can also access manual pages (type:
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">man</span> <span class="pre">ls</span></tt>) or on some systems info pages (type: <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">info</span> <span class="pre">ls</span></tt>). This will
give you more depth to your understanding of what you can do with these
commands.</p>
<p>Getting to &#8216;guru&#8217; status in unix will take you some time, but the more
you explore and try things on the operating system, the more you will
learn. If you are worried about breaking things, or just want to explore
more, buy a cheap computer such as a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">raspberry
pi</a> (around £25), install a free version
of linux on it, and play!</p>
<p>Finally, one other skill you might like to develop is to learn to write
some shell programs (e.g. in bash). This can be a very useful thing to
be able to do as you essentially make your own unix program by combining
others. We will learn such skills using python in subsequent sessions,
but there is value to at least learning the basics in a lower level
shell language (e.g.
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/">bash</a> or
<a class="reference external" href="http://www-cs.canisius.edu/ONLINESTUFF/UNIX/shellprogramming.html">csh</a>.</p>
