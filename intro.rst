Introduction to GeogG122 Scientific Computing
=============================================

Purpose of this course
======================
This course, GeogG122 Scientific Computing, is a term 1 MSc module worth 15 credits (25% of the term 1 credits) that aims to:

* impart an understanding of scientific computing
* give students a grounding in the basic principles of algorithm development and program construction
* to introduce principles of computer-based image analysis and model development

It is open to students from a number of `MSc courses <http://www.geog.ucl.ac.uk/admissions-and-teaching/postgraduates>`_  run by the `Department of Geography <http://www.geog.ucl.ac.uk>`_ `UCL <www.ucl.ac.uk>`_, but the material should be of wider value to others wishing to make use of scientific computing.

The module will cover:

* Introduction to programming (algorithms, data structures, control structures, I/O, languages and pseudocode)
* Introduction to linux environment (login, shell, file systems) and hardware
* Compilation and debugging
* Computing for image analysis (with reference to software such as ENVI/IDL)
* Computing in Python
* Computing for environmental modelling
* Data visualisation for scientific applications

Learning Outcomes
=================
At the end of the module, students should:

* have a working knowledge of linux / unix operating systems and have the knowledge and confidence to obtain, compile and install commonly available scientific software packages
* have an understanding of algorithm development and be able to use widely used scientific computing software to manipulate datasets and accomplish analytical tasks
* have an understanding of the technical issues specific to image-based analysis, model implementation and scientific visualisation

Timetable
==========
The course takes place over 10 weeks in term 1, on Wednesdays usually from 10:00 to 13:00 (09:00-13:00 in t5he first two sessions) in the Geography Department Unix Computing Lab (PB110) in the `Pearson Building, UCL <http://www.ucl.ac.uk/efd/roombooking/building-location/?id=003>`_. Classes take place from the second week of term to the final week of term, other than Reading week. See `UCL term dates for further information <http://www.ucl.ac.uk/transition/joining/all-students/term-dates>`_.

Assessment
==========
Assessment is through one piece of coursework that is submitted in both paper form and electronically via Moodle. See the `Moodle page <http://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=13891>`_ for more details.
