      "A very frequent problem one finds is how to mask out an area in a raster file that is defined as polygon in a shapefile. For example, if you have a raster of the worlds population density, and you want to extract all the pixels that belong to one particular country, how do you go about that? One way around this is to *rasterise* the polygon(s), which translates into \"burning\" pixels that fall within the polygon with a number, resulting in a mask.\n",
      "\n",
      "The way to do this is to use GDAL's `RasterizeLayer` method. The method takes a handle to a GDAL dataset (one that you create yourself, with the right projection and geotransform, as you've seen above), and a OGR layer. The syntax for `RasterizeLayer` is\n",
      "\n",
      "    err = gdal.RasterizeLayer ( raster_ds, [raster_band_no], ogr_layer, burn_values=[burn_val] )\n",
      "    \n",
      "where `raster_ds` is the GDAL raster datasource (note that it needs to be georreferenced, *i.e.* it requires projection and geotransform), `raster_band_no` is the band of the GDAL dataset where we want to burn pixels, `ogr_layer` is the vector layer object, and `burn_val` is the value that we want to burn.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's use `gdal.RasterizeLayer` in conjunction with all that we have covered above. Say we want to create a mask that only selects the UK or Ireland in `world.shp`, and we want to apply this mask to the MODIS landcover product that we used in the GDAL session (h17v03 tile ), file `lc_h17v03.tif`. We find that in this case, `world.shp` is in longitude latitude, and the MODIS data is in the MODIS projection, so we will reproject the vector data to match the MODIS data (so the latter is not interpolated and artifacts introduced). To make this efficient and avoid saving to disk, we shall use *in-memory vector and rasters*, and we will output a numpy array as our mask. Note then the steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Crate the projection conversion object (as for GDAL before)\n",
      "2. Create an in memory **raster** dataset to store the mask, using `lc_h17v03.tif` as a reference for geotransforms, array size and projection.\n",
      "3. Create an in memory **vector** dataset to hold the features that will be reprojected\n",
      "4. Open `world.shp` and apply an `AttributeFilter` to select a country\n",
      "5. Select a geometry from `world.shp`, project it and store it in the destination in memory vector layer\n",
      "6. Once this is done, use `gdal.RasterizeLayer` with both in-memory raster and vector datasets\n",
      "7. Read the in memory raster into an array\n",
